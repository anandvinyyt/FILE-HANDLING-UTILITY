File Handling Utility ‚Äì Java Project :
This Java-based File Handling Utility is a simple and practical application designed to perform essential file operations‚Äîreading, writing, and modifying text files. It demonstrates how Java‚Äôs file I/O capabilities can be effectively used to manage text data in a user-friendly way.

üîß Features
- Read content from any text file and display it on the console.

- Exception Handling (try-catch)

- Scanner class for input

- Basic file path validation

üéØ Objective :
This utility serves as a learning tool for understanding how file operations work in Java. It is useful for Java beginners looking to grasp real-world applications of file handling and exception management.

üìù Usage
